# district-wise-road-stats

This code calculates district wise road statistics using Python's GeoPandas library.

In this example, I have calculated district wise and hierarchy wise road lengths for state of Maharashtra, India, using India district boundaries and central India roads shapefiles.

(Data source: Administrative boundaries - http://projects.datameet.org/maps/districts/#download ; Major Roads - Open street maps)
